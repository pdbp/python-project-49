# Hexlet-code

The project contains 5 games for training logical and mathematical thinking.  

### Installation Instructions

python3 -m pip install --user dist/*.whl  

### Launch Instructions  

To start the game, enter one of the commands:
- brain-even

- brain-prime 

### Rules  

Each game offers answers to automatically generated questions. Each question assumes one of the answers: "yes" or "no". To win the game, you need to answer the questions correctly three times in a row. In case of an incorrect answer, the game ends and it must be started from the beginning.
